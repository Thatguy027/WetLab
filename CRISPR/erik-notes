# GOALS FOR NEXT FEW MONTHS

NILS
  crossing
    speed congenic (mouse technique)

  crispr
    2 gRNAs
    Cas9
    fosmids

put resistant into sensitive to avoid debansky-muler incompatibilities






Make Mutants
  Feed (introduce coCRISPR)
    strain with Cas9
    gRNA in bacteria
  coCRISPR
    gRNA
    Cas9


5-10 genes - allele swaps

Allele swaps


getting rid of coCRISPR
  select for unc-22 heterozygotes by adding nicotinamide

coCRISPR  seems to be the way to go
  we have
    cas9 - sgrna plasmid
    q5 kit to change target sequence
      what is done
        ttTi5605 site target sequence on chr2 - injected - validated
        peel-1 gRNA (?)
        npr-1 gRNA (?)
        fog-2 gRNA (?)
        unc-119 gRNA (?)
          ...these are for tool generation

        ***need unc-22 sgRNA plasmid
          current goal is to do shoot in
              unc-22-cas9 (natural variation)
              target-cas9
              ...is there an issue with cas9 stoicheometry
                .... wormbase forum as a resource

              other possibilities
              also make gfp sgRNA
                put gfp in strains and cut it
              put broken gfp in and fix with sgRNA + HR to fix

** are u6 promoters the same in goldstein and mello papers???
  no they are not. which to use?

bryn idea
put lox-cas9-gfp-lox into ttTi


co-injection marker is myo2-GFP - makes them sick if injected above 5ng/ul
