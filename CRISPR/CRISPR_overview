Summary of talk with Erik

Topic : CRISPR

Overview of next steps:

NIL generation -> CRISPR

NIL generation ::

Method 1 - Traditional NIL generation
We can utilize RIAIL set for generating NILs
For a given QTL confidence interval, assuming CB4856 and N2 have different phenotypes,
  There will be a number of RIAILs that have multiple breakpoints that overlap with a QTL CI
  We can cross the RIAILs to N2/CB followed by crosses to the other genotype in order to generate NILs

Method 2 - Speed congenic approach (mouse technique)
Cross two inbred animals with alternate phenotypes and screen for recombination events that flank QTL CI
**NEED MORE DETAILS**

Method 3 - NIL generation via CRISPR
Identify QTL and introduce sgRNAs that will cut two regions within QTL CI
Introduce fosmid/plasmid from other phenotype genotype with homology to region in injection
Include coCRISPR sgRNA as well
Screen for homologous recombination event of interest
Need to identify how length of possible recombination events

CRISPR ::

My thoughts on conversation with Erik 10.6.2014

coCRISPR seems like the best bet, but we should also generate strains for "Bryn method"

coCRISPR method overview::

coCRISPR targets:
sgRNA for unc-22 (hets twitch in presence of nicotine)
sgRNA for ben-1 (het has sensitivity to benomyl)
sgRNA for GFP

Targets to generate tools for the lab:
peel-1
npr-1
fog-2
unc-119
^^ need sgRNAs for all of these as well

Things that need to be injected into worms:
1) coCRISPR target sgRNA
2) target of interest sgRNA
3) co-injection marker (gfp or rol-6)
4) Cas9 plasmid

What we currently have:
plasmid that contains sgRNA and Cas9 from the Goldstein lab.
**NOTE** this plasmid contains a U6 promoter that is different from the coCRISPR paper U6 promoter


We need to generate/order this plasmid :
1) promoter-sgRNA
   Plasmid will be used for sgRNAs for targets of interest
   We can change sgRNA using Q5 kit and oligos
2) promoter -> unc-22(ben-1, gfp) sgRNA --- U6pr-Cas9
   Plasmid will be the standard coCRISPR plasmid that can be used for all injections

Steps:
Start work on plasmid generation
Practice injections


CRISPR by feeding method (issue is low efficiency):

Plasmid to generate :
homology to ttTi - lox - U6-Cas9 - promoter-GFP - lox - homology to ttTi

This plasmid can be generated and introduced into heritability panel
It can then be used for :
coCRISPR using GFP as off target
CRISPR by feeding

A thought :
Can we
1) Inject strains with extrachromosomal array that contains Cas9 (also co-injection marker)
2) Select F1 worms with co-injection marker
3) Feed F1 bacteria with sgRNA targets

This can be combined with coCRISPR by generating bacteria that contain plasmids that have 2 sgRNAs

Alternatively - we can include fosmids in the injection to mediate homologous recombination in feeding
This would require a plasmid that contains 2 sgRNAs that can be transformed into bacteria
