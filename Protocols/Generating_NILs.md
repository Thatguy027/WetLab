# Generating NILs

### Outlined with an example

#### Etoposide q90.EXT

The above shows an the confidence interval in **red** for etoposide q90.EXT and the genotype for **QX322** around the confidence interval.

### Steps

1. Identify primers to genotype just lines. Utilize indels in the region.
2. Optimize primers using
  1. N2
  2. CB4856
  3. N2/CB4856

  In the above example we PCR amplify at marker 1 and marker 2. In both situations CB4856 has an deletion, which makes the product smaller than N2. Note, that when one worm from each genotype is mixed, we are mimicking a heterozygote, which we need to be able to distinguish from both homozygotes.

3. Bulk cross 1
4. Bulk cross 2
5. Six rounds of single pair matings.

The first cross is between the RIAIL and CB4856.

**NOTE for choosing sex of parents** The above crossing scheme ensures that the first set of offspring generated will be male. This is because male QX322 gametes contribute either X or 0 and CB4856 hermaphrodites contribute X and X gametes. If X QX322 and X CB4856 fuse, then a hermaphrodite will form. Therefore, only males will be hets.

After the second round of crosses, we no longer know the genotype of the males. At this point we need to set up 16 single pair matings.

Once offspring come up from the 16 single pair matings, we need to
1. Confirm successful matings (presence of males)
2. Genotype males from each successful mating **Â¿how many?**
3. Start the next round of 16 single pair matings with one + het male and cb4856
4. Repeat 3 at least 6 times.
5. Self

**NOTE on steps 3-4** Once you identify a plate with a + het, pick 1
