## Qubit Protocol

### For plasmid DNA prep

**1. Gather reagents**
  * BR Buffer and BR Reagent (above qubit analyzer)
  * Tubes - need 2+ number of samples

**2. Make analysis mix**
  * 199µl of buffer + 1µl of reagent
  * Vortex

**3. Grab BR1 and BR2 standards from mini fridge 1 in lab**

**4. Prepare samples**
  * Get tubes read (2 for standard and X for samples)
  * Standards: 190µl of reagent+buffer mix + 10µl of BR1 and BR2 standards
  * Samples: 199µl of reagent+buffer mix + 1µl of sample
  * Vortex and spin
  * Wait 2-3 minutes

**5. Quantify**
  * Touch qubit screen
  * Select dsDNA BR
  * When prompted "read new standard?" click yes
  * Insert BR1 then BR2 to standardize machine
  * The sample
    * You can calculate your concentration on machine by saying you added 1µl of your sample
